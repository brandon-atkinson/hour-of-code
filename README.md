# hour-of-code-2014

Source code used for presenting at the 'Hour of Code' 2014 at Pleasant Hill School.

## Running the code

### Groovy

The groovy examples (with the exception of the rot13.groovy) can be run by copy/pasting them the the [groovy web console](https://groovyconsole.appspot.com/). This allows you to run them without installing groovy.

In order to run rot13.groovy, you need to run groovy from the command-line, which means you'll have to install groovy on your machine. Your best bet is to follow the instructions for [installing groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Installing+Groovy).

After you have groovy installed you should be able to run the scripts like so:

	groovy rot13.groovy
	
### HTML

You should be able to drag/drop the HTML examples into your preferred web browser.
